A promise interface.
<p>
The ref_send API provides a language for expressing eventual control flow, where
operations are only scheduled to happen later, instead of being executed
immediately, as is the case with the normal flow of control in Java. To support
eventual control flow, the ref_send API uses a different kind of reference,
called a promise. A promise is a reference to an object which has yet to be
determined. It's this flexibility that enables coding of an algorithm that
manipulates values which won't be calculated until later, as is done in eventual
control flow.
</p>
<p>
One way to think about promises is as a generalization of floating point
numbers. Floating point arithmetic has a special way of dealing with error
conditions, different from that used in integer arithmetic. For example, the
expression "<code>0 / 0</code>" will throw an
{@link java.lang.ArithmeticException}, which aborts the current flow of control.
In contrast, the expression "<code>0.0 / 0.0</code>" does not throw an
exception, instead returning a special value called a <code>NaN</code> and
allowing the current flow of control to continue.
</p>
<p>
Like a floating point number, a promise can represent either a normal value or
an error condition. A {@link org.ref_send.promise.Fulfilled} promise is a
wrapper containing a normal Java reference. A
{@link org.ref_send.promise.Rejected} promise is a wrapper containing an
{@link java.lang.Exception} specifying the details of the error condition.
Instead of throwing an exception, thus terminating the current flow of control,
an expression that returns a {@link org.ref_send.promise.Promise} can return a
{@link org.ref_send.promise.Rejected} promise to indicate an error condition, or
a {@link org.ref_send.promise.Fulfilled} promise for a normal result. Most
often, an expression will only need to be coded to return a
{@link org.ref_send.promise.Fulfilled} promise, so some syntactic sugar is
provided to facilitate construction. For example:
</p>
<pre>
import static org.ref_send.promise.Fulfilled.ref;
&hellip;

    private int balance;
    &hellip;
    
    public Promise&lt;Integer&gt;
    getBalance() { return ref(balance); }
    &hellip;
</pre>
<p>
The static {@link org.ref_send.promise.Fulfilled#ref ref()} function takes a
normal Java reference and returns a corresponding
{@link org.ref_send.promise.Promise}.
</p>
<p>
Constructing a {@link org.ref_send.promise.Rejected} promise is a little more
verbose. For example:
</p>
<pre>
import static org.ref_send.promise.Fulfilled.ref;
&hellip;

    private int balance;
    &hellip;
    
    public Promise&lt;Integer&gt;
    getBalance() {
        if (balance < 0) {
            return new Rejected&lt;Integer&gt;(new Overdraft());
        }
        return ref(balance);
    }
    &hellip;
</pre>
<p>
In floating point arithmetic, the <code>NaN</code> value is contagious, meaning
that any other expression that uses it also returns <code>NaN</code>. For
example, the expression "<code>0.0 / 0.0 + 1.0</code>" also returns
<code>NaN</code>. An algorithm that uses floating point numbers can thus be
coded such that it always runs to completion and the error condition is
propagated through to the return value. A {@link org.ref_send.promise.Rejected}
promise can be used in a similar way by turning it
{@linkplain org.ref_send.promise.Rejected#_ into a proxy}, which can then be
used like any other object implementing the specified interface. For example:
</p>
<pre>
public interface
Account {
    public Promise&lt;Integer&gt;
    getBalance();
}
    
public class
Customer {
    &hellip;

    public Account
    getSavings() {
        if (frozen) {
            return new Rejected&lt;Account&gt;(new Frozen())._(Account.class);
        }
        return savings;
    }
}

&hellip;
    final Customer client = &hellip;
    final Promise&lt;Integer&gt; current = client.getSavings().getBalance();
    &hellip;
</pre>
<p>
In the above code, the <code>current</code> balance will be a
{@link org.ref_send.promise.Rejected} promise, with
{@linkplain org.ref_send.promise.Rejected#reason reason} <code>Frozen</code>, if
the customer's savings account has been frozen by the bank. The
{@link org.ref_send.promise.Rejected} promise was originally produced by the
<code>getSavings()</code> method, but propagated through the
<code>getBalance()</code> invocation to the <code>current</code> balance.
</p>
<p>
In addition to representing a normal or error condition, a promise is most
useful for representing a value which is yet to be determined. Such a promise
may be used to refer to a value which will be calculated later, based on inputs
which are not yet known. The {@link org.ref_send.promise.eventual.Eventual}
class supports creating this kind of
{@linkplain org.ref_send.promise.eventual.Eventual#defer deferred promise}, as
well as doing
{@linkplain org.ref_send.promise.eventual.Eventual#when conditional operations}
on promises.
