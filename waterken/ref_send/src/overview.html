Defensive programming in Java.
<p>
This library provides defensive programming primitives for the Java language
similar to those defined in Mark Miller's dissertation:
"<a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/">Robust Composition: Towards a
Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control</a>". Through
clever use of naming conventions and Java 1.5 language features, ref_send
provides a syntactically convenient language for implementing defensively
consistent Java classes. By using ref_send in tandem with the
<a href="http://joe-e.org/">Joe-E</a> verifier, developers can program in the
object-capability paradigm using their preferred Java IDE and deploy their
applications on stock JVMs with the performance characteristics of code
written in the Java language.
