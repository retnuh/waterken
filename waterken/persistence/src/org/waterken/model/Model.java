/**
 * A persistent application model.
 * <p>
 * This class gets its name from the Model in the Model-View-Control (MVC)
 * pattern. An application should be composed of separate classes that fall into
 * only one of these categories. Objects forming the application's model should
 * be stored in the {@link Model} to make them persistent. Objects in the other
 * categories should be transient and so reconstructed each time the application
 * is revived from its persistent state. Following this convention reduces the
 * number of classes with a persistent representation that MUST be supported
 * across application upgrade. When designing classes for your model, take care
 * to limit their complexity and plan for upgrade.

     * model at any time. An invocation from another thread MUST block until the
     * model becomes available. A recursive invocation from the same thread MUST
     * cause an error.
     * </p>

     * If {@link Transaction#run invocation} of the <code>body</code> causes
     * an {@link Error}, all modifications to objects in the model MUST be
     * discarded, and the {@link Error} allowed to propagate up the call chain.
     * For subsequent transactions, it MUST be as if the aborted transaction was
     * never attempted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The implementation MUST NOT rely on the <code>extend</code> argument
     * accurately describing the behavior of the <code>body</code> argument.
     * If {@link #extend} is specified, the implementation MUST check that no
     * existing state was modified. If state was modified, the transaction MUST
     * be aborted, in the same manner described previously.
     * {@link Root#store Storing} a new {@link Root root} binding is considered
     * a modification.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>body</code> MUST NOT retain references to any of the objects
     * in the model beyond completion of the transaction. The model
     * implementation can rely on the <code>body</code> being well-behaved in
     * this respect. An identifier for an object in the model may be retained
     * across transactions by either {@link Root#store storing} it in the
     * {@link Root}, or {@link Heap#locate locating} the object in the
     * {@link Root#heap persistent address space}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If invocation of this method returns without producing an {@link Error},
     * all modifications to objects in the model MUST be committed. Only if the
     * current transaction commits will the {@link Root#effect enqueued}
     * {@link Effect}s be {@link Transaction#run executed}; otherwise, the
     * implementation MUST discarded them. The effects MUST be executed in the
     * same order as they were enqueued. Effects from a subsequent transaction
     * MUST NOT be executed until all effects from the current transaction have
     * been executed. An {@link Effect} MUST NOT access objects in the model,
     * but may schedule additional effects.
