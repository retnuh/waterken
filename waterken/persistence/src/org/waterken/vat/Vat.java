     * The implementation MUST ensure only one transaction is active in the vat
     * at any time. An invocation from another thread MUST block until the vat
     * becomes available. A recursive invocation from the same thread MUST throw
     * an {@link Exception}.

     * discarded. For subsequent transactions, it MUST be as if the aborted
     * transaction was never attempted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The implementation MUST NOT rely on the {@link Transaction#isQuery}
     * argument accurately describing the transaction's behavior. If
     * {@link Transaction#query} is specified, the implementation MUST check
     * that the constraints are met; if not, the transaction MUST be aborted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>body</code> MUST NOT retain references to any of the objects
     * in the vat beyond completion of the transaction. The vat implementation
     * can rely on the <code>body</code> being well-behaved in this respect.
     * An identifier for an object in the vat may be retained across
     * transactions by either {@linkplain Root#link linking}, or
     * {@linkplain Root#export exporting} it.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If invocation of this method returns normally, all modifications to
     * objects in the vat MUST be committed. Only if the current transaction
     * commits will the {@linkplain Root#effect enqueued} {@link Effect}s be
     * {@linkplain #enter executed}; otherwise, the implementation MUST discard
     * them. The effects MUST be executed in the same order as they were
     * enqueued. Effects from a subsequent transaction MUST NOT be executed
     * until all effects from the current transaction have been executed. An
     * {@link Effect} MUST NOT access objects in the vat, but may schedule
     * additional effects.
