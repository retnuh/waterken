     * discarded. For subsequent transactions, it MUST be as if the aborted
     * transaction was never attempted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The implementation MUST NOT rely on the <code>extend</code> argument
     * accurately describing the behavior of the <code>body</code> argument.
     * If {@link #extend} is specified, the implementation MUST check that the
     * constraints are met; if not, the transaction MUST be aborted.
     * {@linkplain Root#link Linking} a new {@link Root root} value is
     * considered a modification.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>body</code> MUST NOT retain references to any of the objects
     * in the vat beyond completion of the transaction. The vat
     * implementation can rely on the <code>body</code> being well-behaved in
     * this respect. An identifier for an object in the vat may be retained
     * across transactions by either {@linkplain Root#link linking}, or
     * {@linkplain Root#export exporting} it.

     * <p>
     * If invocation of this method returns normally, all modifications to
     * objects in the vat MUST be committed. Only if the current transaction
     * commits will the {@linkplain Root#effect enqueued} {@link Effect}s be
     * {@linkplain Transaction#run executed}; otherwise, the implementation
     * MUST discard them. The effects MUST be executed in the same order as
     * they were enqueued. Effects from a subsequent transaction MUST NOT be
     * executed until all effects from the current transaction have been
     * executed. An {@link Effect} MUST NOT access objects in the vat, but may
