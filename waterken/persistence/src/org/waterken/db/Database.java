     * The implementation MUST ensure only one transaction is active in the
     * database at any time. An invocation from another thread MUST block until
     * the database becomes available. A recursive invocation from the same
     * thread MUST throw an {@link Exception}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If {@linkplain Transaction#run invocation} of the <code>body</code>
     * causes an {@link Error}, the transaction MUST be aborted. When a
     * transaction is aborted, all modifications to objects in the database MUST
     * be discarded. For subsequent transactions, it MUST be as if the aborted
     * transaction was never attempted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The implementation MUST NOT rely on the <code>isQuery</code>
     * argument accurately describing the transaction's behavior. If
     * {@link #query} is specified, the implementation MUST check that the
     * constraints are met; if not, the transaction MUST be aborted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>body</code> MUST NOT retain references to any of the objects
     * in the database beyond completion of the transaction. The database
     * implementation can rely on the <code>body</code> being well-behaved in
     * this respect. An identifier for an object in the database may be retained
     * across transactions by either {@linkplain Root#link linking}, or
     * {@linkplain Root#export exporting} it.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If invocation of this method returns normally, all modifications to
     * objects in the database MUST be committed. Only if the current
     * transaction commits will the {@linkplain #effect enqueued}
     * {@link Effect}s be {@linkplain #enter executed}; otherwise, the
     * implementation MUST discard them. The effects MUST be executed in the
     * same order as they were enqueued. Effects from a subsequent transaction
     * MUST NOT be executed until all effects from the current transaction have
     * been executed. An {@link Effect} MUST NOT access objects in the database,
     * but may schedule additional effects.
