Inter-model messaging.
<p>
When using the Waterken Server, each Java reference created by an application
can be exported to HTTP clients as a URL. These clients, including other
Waterken Server instances, can then interact with the referenced Java object by
sending HTTP requests using the exported URL.  This package provides an
interface that provides additional access to the HTTP messaging layer.
</p>
<p>
Using an {@linkplain org.ref_send.promise.eventual.Eventual#cast eventual
reference}, code written to the ref_send API can send HTTP requests. For
example, the following code:
</p>
<pre>
final Drum drum_ = &hellip;
final Promise&lt;Integer&gt; hits = drum_.getHits();
</pre>
<p>
results in an HTTP request like:
</p>
<pre>
GET /-/bang/?p=hits&amp;s=mvrgdn3rvq7qmy HTTP/1.1
Host: vsci.hpl.hp.com

</pre>
<p>
If the request is processed successfully, the <code>hits</code> promise will
eventually resolve to an {@link java.lang.Integer} indicating the number of
times the drum has been banged. On the other hand, should there be an
application level problem with the request, such as attempting to access a drum
which no longer exists, the <code>hits</code> promise will eventually
transition to the rejected state with a
{@linkplain org.ref_send.promise.Rejected#reason reason}
{@link java.lang.Exception} providing details about the problem. For example:
</p>
<pre>
final int expected = &hellip;   // the expected number of hits
class Was extends Do&lt;Integer,Boolean&gt; implements Serializable {
    static public final int serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public Boolean
    fulfill(final Integer reported) {
        &hellip;    // compare reported value to expected value
    }

    public Boolean
    reject(final Exception reason) {
        if (reason instanceof {@link org.web_send.Failure}) {
            // HTTP request failed
            final Failure e = (Failure)reason;
            if ("410".equals(e.status)) {
                // the target drum no longer exists!
                &hellip;
            }
            &hellip;
        }
        &hellip;
    }
}
&hellip; = _.when(hits, new Was());
</pre>
<p>
By default, all invocation arguments and return values are represented as
<a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> in HTTP requests and responses. Sometimes,
an application may need to use another Content-Type to interact with a specific
client, or to transfer raw bytes. This can be accomplished using an
{@link org.web_send.Entity}. For example, the following code:
</p>
<pre>
public {@link org.web_send.Entity}
getGreeting() {
    return new Entity(
        "text/plain; charset=US-ASCII",
        {@link org.joe_e.array.ByteArray}.array({@link org.joe_e.charset.ASCII}.encode("Hello World!\n"))
    );
}
</pre>
<p>
returns the following HTTP response to a <code>GET</code> request:
</p>
<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Length: 13

Hello World!
</pre>
